        update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.\n\nRed
        Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of
        Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
        gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from
        the CVE link(s) in the References section.\n\nThe kernel packages contain
        the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.\n\nSecurity Fix(es)
        :\n\n* Linux kernel built with the Kernel-based Virtual Machine (CONFIG_KVM)
        support is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference flaw.\nIt could occur
        on x86 platform, when emulating an undefined instruction. An attacker could
        use this flaw to crash the host kernel resulting in DoS. (CVE-2016-8630, Important)\n\n*
        A race condition issue leading to a use-after-free flaw was found in the way
        the raw packet sockets implementation in the Linux kernel networking subsystem
        handled synchronization while creating the TPACKET_V3 ring buffer. A local
        user able to open a raw packet socket (requires the CAP_NET_RAW capability)
        could use this flaw to elevate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2016-8655,
        Important)\n\n* A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel''s implementation
        of VFIO.\nAn attacker issuing an ioctl can create a situation where memory
        is corrupted and modify memory outside of the expected area. This may overwrite
        kernel memory and subvert kernel execution. (CVE-2016-9083, Important)\n\n*
        The use of a kzalloc with an integer multiplication allowed an integer overflow
        condition to be reached in vfio_pci_intrs.c. This combined with CVE-2016-9083
        may allow an attacker to craft an attack and use unallocated memory, potentially
        crashing the machine.\n(CVE-2016-9084, Moderate)\n\nRed Hat would like to
        thank Philip Pettersson for reporting CVE-2016-8655.\n\nAdditional Changes

        A race condition issue leading to a use-after-free flaw was found in the way
        the raw packet sockets implementation in the Linux kernel networking subsystem
        handled synchronization while creating the TPACKET_V3 ring buffer. A local
        user able to open a raw packet socket (requires the CAP_NET_RAW capability)
        could use this flaw to elevate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2016-8655,
        Important)\n\n* A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel''s implementation
        of VFIO.\nAn attacker issuing an ioctl can create a situation where memory
        is corrupted and modify memory outside of the expected area. This may overwrite
        kernel memory and subvert kernel execution. (CVE-2016-9083, Important)\n\n*
        The use of a kzalloc with an integer multiplication allowed an integer overflow
        condition to be reached in vfio_pci_intrs.c. This combined with CVE-2016-9083
        may allow an attacker to craft an attack and use unallocated memory, potentially
