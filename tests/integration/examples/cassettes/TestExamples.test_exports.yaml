        update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.\n\nRed
        Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of
        Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
        gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from
        the CVE link(s) in the References section.\n\nThe kernel packages contain
        the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.\n\nSecurity Fix(es)
        :\n\n* Linux kernel built with the Kernel-based Virtual Machine (CONFIG_KVM)
        support is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference flaw.\nIt could occur
        on x86 platform, when emulating an undefined instruction. An attacker could
        use this flaw to crash the host kernel resulting in DoS. (CVE-2016-8630, Important)\n\n*
        A race condition issue leading to a use-after-free flaw was found in the way
        the raw packet sockets implementation in the Linux kernel networking subsystem
        handled synchronization while creating the TPACKET_V3 ring buffer. A local
        user able to open a raw packet socket (requires the CAP_NET_RAW capability)
        could use this flaw to elevate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2016-8655,
        Important)\n\n* A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel''s implementation
        of VFIO.\nAn attacker issuing an ioctl can create a situation where memory
        is corrupted and modify memory outside of the expected area. This may overwrite
        kernel memory and subvert kernel execution. (CVE-2016-9083, Important)\n\n*
        The use of a kzalloc with an integer multiplication allowed an integer overflow
        condition to be reached in vfio_pci_intrs.c. This combined with CVE-2016-9083
        may allow an attacker to craft an attack and use unallocated memory, potentially
        crashing the machine.\n(CVE-2016-9084, Moderate)\n\nRed Hat would like to
        thank Philip Pettersson for reporting CVE-2016-8655.\n\nAdditional Changes

        Red Hat Enterprise Linux. The CentOS Project is the organization that builds
        CentOS. We mainly change packages to remove upstream vendor branding and artwork.</p>

        A race condition issue leading to a use-after-free flaw was found in the way
        the raw packet sockets implementation in the Linux kernel networking subsystem
        handled synchronization while creating the TPACKET_V3 ring buffer. A local

        of VFIO.\nAn attacker issuing an ioctl can create a situation where memory
        is corrupted and modify memory outside of the expected area. This may overwrite
        kernel memory and subvert kernel execution. (CVE-2016-9083, Important)\n\n*
        The use of a kzalloc with an integer multiplication allowed an integer overflow
        condition to be reached in vfio_pci_intrs.c. This combined with CVE-2016-9083
        may allow an attacker to craft an attack and use unallocated memory, potentially

        update for kernel is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.\n\nRed
        Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of
        Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
        gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from
        the CVE link(s) in the References section.\n\nThe kernel packages contain
        the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.\n\nSecurity Fix(es)
        :\n\n* Linux kernel built with the Kernel-based Virtual Machine (CONFIG_KVM)
        support is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference flaw.\nIt could occur
        on x86 platform, when emulating an undefined instruction. An attacker could
        use this flaw to crash the host kernel resulting in DoS. (CVE-2016-8630, Important)\n\n*
        A race condition issue leading to a use-after-free flaw was found in the way
        the raw packet sockets implementation in the Linux kernel networking subsystem
        handled synchronization while creating the TPACKET_V3 ring buffer. A local
        user able to open a raw packet socket (requires the CAP_NET_RAW capability)
        could use this flaw to elevate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2016-8655,
        Important)\n\n* A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel''s implementation
        of VFIO.\nAn attacker issuing an ioctl can create a situation where memory
        is corrupted and modify memory outside of the expected area. This may overwrite
        kernel memory and subvert kernel execution. (CVE-2016-9083, Important)\n\n*
        The use of a kzalloc with an integer multiplication allowed an integer overflow
        condition to be reached in vfio_pci_intrs.c. This combined with CVE-2016-9083
        may allow an attacker to craft an attack and use unallocated memory, potentially
        crashing the machine.\n(CVE-2016-9084, Moderate)\n\nRed Hat would like to
        thank Philip Pettersson for reporting CVE-2016-8655.\n\nAdditional Changes
        :\n\nSpace precludes documenting all of the bug fixes and enhancements included
